Gol is a simple multiplayer web-based soccer game.

New players are assigned to a random team if the count is even, or to the team
with fewer players otherwise.  Each team tries to bounce the ball into the
opponent's goal.  When a team scores a goal, the ball is returned to the center
and the players are placed randomly on their respective sides.  The scoring
team may not enter the center circle until the other team kicks off.  Once one
team reaches 10 points, the scores are reset to 0 and a new game begins.
