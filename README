Gol is a simple multiplayer web-based soccer game.

New players are assigned to a random team if the count is even, or to the team
with fewer players otherwise.  Each team tries to bounce the ball into the
opponent's goal.  When a team scores a goal, the ball is returned to the center
and the players are placed randomly on their respective sides.  The team that
was scored on gets a slight head start when play resumes.  Once one team
reaches 100 points, the scores are reset to 0 and a new game begins.

Gol depends on the C Chipmunk Physics library, and has been tested with
version 6.1.4 available at:

  http://chipmunk-physics.net/release/Chipmunk-6.x/Chipmunk-6.1.4.tgz

If Chipmunk is installed in a nonstandard location, you need to set environment
variables to tell Go where to find it:

  CGO_CFLAGS=-I/path/to/chipmunk/includes
  CGO_LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/chipmunk/library
